TechIndyeah officially started up in 2012. The journey in the making of TechIndyeah started long back in 2009 when Ranjan was working on web designing, logo designing. letterheads and serving other corporate needs. After that he decided to shift the companyâ€™s interest into more deeper technologies where the company was still in its infancy. It was catering to application development, corporate identity management, business support, offline and online email server management and more. Slowly the company started growing as it expanded its wings to other areas of core technology like web hosting, website development, remote database management, IT infrastructure as well as embedded systems. Today the company stands strong with a vision to do more for India as TechIndyeah. The startup has been journeying through trial and errors and with each passing day it has seen so many avenues opening up where TechIndyeah can play an important role to integrate technology in our day to day lives.
